# Hello-World

Are you lost?

So... i picked up a new hobby I always wanted to try... now I am here trying to tell something about myself. When I was little I wanted to become a pilot, then I got older, life got thougher and I started questioning myself more and more. Is this who I am, is This what I want to be, who I want others to see me as. Life is hard and not fair but I feel lucky. Lucky to be here , lucky to be who I am, lucky to give what I have. There is always balance and happyness in ones life its just the matter of perspective.
